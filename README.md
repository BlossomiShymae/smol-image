# smol-image

A simple GUI executable that automatically downscales and copies any drag-n-dropped image to the system clipboard.
Useful for quickly sharing emote-sized images on Discord. :3

Requires Java 17+ runtime.

## Notes
Animated GIF images currently do not work due to an almost 20-year-old bug. Attempting to do so
will freeze the program. :c
